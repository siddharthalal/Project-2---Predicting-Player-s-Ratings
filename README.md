# Predicting-Player's-Ratings

In this project, we are going to predict the overall rating of soccer player based on their attributes such as 'crossing', 'finishing etc.

The dataset that we are going to use is from European Soccer Database (https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer). 

We will be building two different models using Linear and Random Forest regression techniques, and evalaute those models to judge their accuracy and efficiency.
